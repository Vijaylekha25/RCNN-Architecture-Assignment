    "\n",
    "#### 1. Region Proposal\n",
    "Region Proposal is the initial phase where the algorithm identifies potential regions within an image that might contain objects. Selective Search is often used for this purpose, generating a set of candidate regions that are likely to contain objects by merging superpixels based on similarity in color, texture, size, and shape. This step aims to cover all possible objects while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "Resizing each region proposal to a fixed size required by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\n",
    "Normalizing the pixel values to match the distribution expected by the CNN (e.g., mean subtraction, scaling to a specific range).\n",
    "#### 3. Pre-training the CNN Architecture\n",
    "Pre-training the CNN Architecture focuses on leveraging a CNN that has been pre-trained on a large dataset, typically for image classification tasks (e.g., ImageNet). This pre-trained CNN serves as a feature extractor for the region proposals. The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading a pre-trained CNN: Using models like VGG, ResNet, or other architectures.\n",
    "Fine-tuning the CNN: Adapting the pre-trained model to better suit the specific task of segmentation by training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Extracting features: Using the CNN to convert each region proposal into a feature vector.\n",
    "Training the SVM: Using these feature vectors to train an SVM classifier to distinguish between different object classes.\n",
    "#### 5. Clean Up\n",
    "Clean Up refers to post-processing steps aimed at refining the initial segmentation results. This might involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): Removing redundant and overlapping region proposals to ensure that each object is represented by a single, best-fitting region.\n",
    "Boundary refinement: Adjusting the boundaries of the detected regions to more precisely fit the actual object edges.\n",
